        <p className="mr-2">
          I have always had a love for computers and learning how they work. This passion, took
          sometime to eventuate, but eventually led me to a career in software development.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          While my journey is not the same as the standard computer science student, I am glad
          things have panned out this way. The time I spent in commerce and banking has given me a
          unique perspective on software development and the tech industry as a whole. I have also
          gained valuable skills in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving that I believe are
          essential for any developer.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          Now, as a highly motivated developer with a passion for continuous learning and growth, I
          am driven by the goal of developing high-quality code that leads to high-quality products.
          My current work has led me to specialise in frontend development using TypeScript and
          React, as well as backend development with Elixir. I have also continued to learn a
          multitude of other important languages as well as concepts in my own time. I am eager to
          leverage my experience and passion for software to innovate and build products that make a
          positive impact on the world.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mb-2 pt-4 text-2xl font-bold">Interests</h2>
        <p className="">
          Outside of coding, I enjoy playing and watching sport, reading, and spending quality time
          with my friends and faimily. I also love going camping, always looking for new places to
          explore. Over the Last 2 years I built a campervan with the help of my partner, which we
          use to explore all different places.
